`EntityCollection` class now lives in `mammos_entity._entity_collection` and can be accessed with `mammos_entity.EntityCollection`. Operations are moved into the `mammos_entity.operations` submodules and are not accessible directly from `mammos_entity` anymore. Internally, some private submodules were renamed: `_base` -> `_entity`, `_entities` -> `_factory`, and `_onto` -> `_ontology`.
